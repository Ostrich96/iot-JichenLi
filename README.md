[2020-09-14]Bought a Raspberry Pi 4B and a 32GB sd card. Download the Noobs program and the ssh to manage the Raspberry Pi through my laptop\

[2020-10-3] forget to update my progress. have learn some video about Raspberry Pi. decide to make a cnn network using Movidius Neural Compute Stick and Raspberry Pi. With Movidius Neural Compute Stick, the RP can run some deep learning network and get more functions like face detection.\
[2020-10-10] learn about the Docker showed in the Lab5a, its a package of the code we run, pack all the code into one docker.\
[2020-10-12] Do the Lab5A as the lesson5 has showed. \
[2020-10-18]I'm making a security camera, using Human body sensing module. If the sensing detect human motion, the Raspberry Pi will start the camera and start recording. Meanwhile the Raspberry Pi can analysis human face in the video. If it is a stranger, the raspberry will send a message to my phone and I can watch the situation through Raspberry Pi's camera on the phone.\
[2020-10-27]Connecting the Human body sensing module. And my camera for Raspberry Pi still on the road...\
[2020-11-1]Learning to build a CNN for face recognition.
